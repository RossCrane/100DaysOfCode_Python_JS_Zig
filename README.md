# 100DaysOfCode_Python_JS_Zig

## By: Ross Crane (RecuRoss)

I am currently undertaking the 100 Days of Code challenge by Dr. Angela Yu, where I will be focusing on Python, JavaScript, and Zig. This challenge will not only help me improve my Python skills but also allow me to learn Zig and further enhance my JavaScript expertise. While I will do my best to stick to the 100-day timeline, there may be instances where I take days off or split days up. Nevertheless, I am committed to making consistent progress and completing the challenge successfully.

### Day 1 3/24/2024

Notes: Installed everything I needed and setup folder structure with a bash script. Created hello world files for all three languages. I had to look up most of the syntax for Zig but JS and Py only took seconds. Learned about Thonny for debugging Python code, which seams really neat.
